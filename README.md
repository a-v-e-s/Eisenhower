<h1>Eisenhower Matrix App:</h1><br/>
<p>This application is designed to facilitate properly prioritizing tasks based on their relative importance and urgency.<br/>
The git repository contains two branches, one well tested and stable: master, and one under active development: experimental<br/>
Currently it supports a maximum of 12 tasks, and is a little bit ugly, but these problems will be fixed soon.<br/>
There is only one script in the master branch, and the top-level script in the experimental branch is gui.py<br/>
